Next.js Starter Project Folder Structure:

1. pages/

This directory is core to the functionality of Next.js. Every JavaScript (or TypeScript) file in this directory becomes an automatically routed page in the app.

    _app.js: This is a custom App component. It allows you to override the default App component provided by Next.js to initialize pages. You can apply shared components or styles across all routes, such as a navigation bar, using this file.

    index.js: Represents the main homepage (root route) of the application. When you visit your site's root URL, the code and rendering logic within this file will be used.

    _document.js (not in the default starter but commonly used): Allows you to augment the app's HTML and body tags. Useful for adding attributes or integrating external resources.

2. public/

    The public directory serves as the base path for serving static assets. Unlike assets in the pages/ or other directories, files here aren't processed by Webpack. They are served as-is to the browser.

    For instance, if you have an image named background.png inside the public directory, you'd reference it in your code like so: <img src="/background.png" />.

3. styles/

Next.js allows you to import stylesheets into your JS/TS files. This directory holds those styles.

    globals.css: This stylesheet holds global styles that are applied across your entire app. For instance, you might put default styles or resets here.

    Home.module.css: This is a CSS Module, a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. Using CSS Modules, you can write modular and maintainable CSS. The naming convention [name].module.css is required for Next.js to treat it as a CSS module.

4. .gitignore

    This file is used by Git to determine which files and directories to ignore when making commits. Commonly ignored files include node_modules/, build directories, .env files with secrets, etc.

5. package.json

    An essential file for Node.js projects, it holds metadata about the project, lists its dependencies, and can contain scripts that automate common tasks (like starting your Next.js app in development mode).

6. README.md

    A markdown file that provides documentation about the project. It's a good place to put setup instructions, describe the project's purpose, and provide any other pertinent information for developers or users.
